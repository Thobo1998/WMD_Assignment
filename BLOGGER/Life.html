                    <p>
                    The Vatican city or Vaticano, if not the entire world, most people know it to be
                    the origin or the headquaters of Roman Catholism and the residence of the bishop of rome 
                    <em>The pope</em>.The popes have been contolling the papal states as we now know as ITALY.
                    On the 13th of MAY 1897, the new italian state prohibited the pope's temporal authority to
                    the Vatican and Lateran areas of Rome and the
                    rural retreat of Castel Gandolfo (Inspiration to Lord The Rings). The pope's refused to 
                    acknowlegde the vadility of this law until the concordat of 11 February 1929 gave the 
                    Catholic Church special status in Italy and Paid an indemnity to the now independent 
                    <strong>Vatican City</strong>.

                <a href="#">Other Factors:</a>
                <p>
                <strong>Location and Geography</strong>: The Vatican's 108.7 arcs are completely surrounded
                by Rome. 

                <strong>Geography</strong>: There are about 850 Italian and Swiss permanent residents, 
                along with lay workers from Catholic communities around the world.

                <strong>Linguistic Affiliation</strong>: The major languages are italian and Latin.

                <strong>Symbolism</strong>: The pope represents a link between <em>Saint Peter</em> and 
                <em>Jesus</em>. Vatican ceremonies recall the words and actions of Jesus and his followers.
                Candles, increase and various rituals carry symbolic meaning. The Vatican is a symbol of 
                Church leadership and it's apostolic tradition.

            <h1>History and Ethnic Relations</h1>
                <p>
                <strong>Emergency of the nation</strong>: The Vatican is a successor to the Papal States,
                which made up a large area of central Italy. After The unification of Italy, the new state 
                annexed the Papal States after Germany defeated France, which had protected the pope's 
                interests, in the Franco Prussian War (1870-1871). The popes refused to leave , declaring
                themselves "Prisoners of the Vatican", until Bennito Mussolini signed agreements in 1979
                granting the Church special privileges in Italy and a cash statement. The Vatican was given
                independence under papal rule. Since that time, the Vatican has been an independent state
                that sends and receives AMBASSADORS.<strong>National Identity</strong>: The Vatican's 
                identity is religious, not national. It presents itself as transitional and universal.
                <strong>Ethnic Relations</strong>: The Vatican has sought ties with members of all ethnic
                groups as part of its universal religious identity.

                <h1>Urbanism, Architecture and the Use of Space</h1>
                <p>
                The Vatican is entirely urban. It has many artistic and architectural masterpieces, includeing 
                Saitn Peter's Cathedral and Sistine Chapel. Despite its small are there is a sense of opennes 
                and comfort.

                </div>
               <h1>Food and Economy</h1>
                <p>
                <strong>Food in Daily Life</strong>: The major food style is that of Rome. For instance other 
                italians, residents of the Vatican consider the cooking the best in the world. Pope "John Paul 
                II" caused a furor when he requested Polish cooking from papal chef. <strong>Foods Customs at 
                Ceremonial Occasions</strong>: On New Years Eve, the Iltalian tradition is to have the meal of 
                the seven fish, including eel, conch and squid. Lamb is a tradition Easter dish. For each meal,
                there is always a pasta course.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <strong>Basic Economy</strong>: The economy is based on religious work the Vatican receives 
                contributions from churches around the world. Tourists come to visit religious shrines and 
                view art. The major commercial activities are organized around religious concerns, the 
                major industry is governance of the church, and trade is organized around religious goods.
                <strong>Land Tenure and Property</strong>: The Church owns all property in Vatican City 
                and areas outside the Vatican covered by extraterritorial rights. <strong>Division of 
                Labor</strong>: The Curia rules the church under the pope. Its members come from countries 
                around the world and work in many governmental departments. The pope presides over the 
                bureaucracy, delegating and consulting with his subordinates. The heads of the important
                bureaus tned to be cardinals.

                <br>
                
                   <h1>Socical Stratification</h1>
                    
                <p>
                <strong>Classes and Castes</strong>: The Vaican is highly stratified. The pope is at the apex
                of the hierachy and cardinal-archibops, bishops, monsignors, priests and others that come 
                below him, followed by the heads of bureaus. Lay worksers generally rank below the clergy.
                <strong>Symbols of Social Stratification</strong>: Clerical dress marks a person's rank. The 
                pope's white robes distinguish him clearly. Cardinals wearred, and the are noted by their 
                styles of dress and rings. Style of clothing, place in a procession line, and seating are 
                also marks of social position.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h1>Political Law</h1>
                <p>
                <strong>Government</strong>: The basic law is the code of Canon Law. Church councils meet
                approximately once per century. Bishops synods meet periodically and offer advice, but 
                the day-to-day running of the Vatican is in the hands of appointed officials who oversee 
                the Curia.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <strong>Leadership and Political Officials</strong>: There are no political parties, but the 
                positions held by the clergy and the laity cover a wide spectrum of opinion, although those 
                positions are not always equally represented. There is an elaborate code etiquitte for 
                approachinf officials. Generally, go betweens are used to arrange meetings. Much is done 
                informally. There is a feeling that consensus should be reached before decisions are 
                published. Therefore, things are discussed at length before the pope speaks officialy.
                <strong>Social Problems and Control</strong>: There is little crime and the typical Problems 
                are dispurtes over religious doctrine and governance. Strict statements and actions regarding 
                conformity to doctrine, including censorship and the silence of dissidents have alternated 
                with attempts at persuasion and expressions of conciliation. <strong>Military Activity</strong> 
                The Vatican is officially neutral in world affairs but can mediate disputes if invited to do 
                so. Swiss guards in medieval uniforms protect the pope and the city.

                <br> 
                <p>
                There are social welfare programs for employees. Catholic charity organizations promote social 
                welfare and change throughout the world.
                </p>

                <br> 
                <p>
                In the Vatican, there are no distinctions between church and safe. The Vatican works with many 
                secular organizations.

                <br> 
                <p>
                The ethos is male-dominated. There have been efforts toward greater gender equality, especially 
                on the part of nuns. However, as long as the priesthood is reserved for males, it will be 
                difficult to achieve such equality. Men hold the vast majority of key positions.

                <br> 
                <p>
                The married people in the vatican are mainly community workers whose family arrangements are 
                the same as those in Italy.

                <br> 
                <p>
                The Vatican insists on modest and appropriate dress in its sacred places. Silence is valued 
                sacred areas, and deference to the clergy is expected. There is strict adherence to speaking
                only when addressed and deferring to senior officials.

                <br> 
                <p>
                <strong>Religious Beliefs</strong>: The Vatican is a Catholic state whose population is 
                virtually 100 percent Roman Catholic. There is a belief in heaven and hell and in just 
                in rewards on punishments for one's actions on earth. There is a belief in a supreme 
                triune GOD, and various saints are honored. The final judgement and ressurection of the 
                dead are tenets of the faith. <strong>Religious Practitioners</strong>: The Catholic 
                clergy are the major religious practitioners and can administer the seven sacraments, 
                depending on their rank. Bishop can ordain other priests. <strong>Riruals and Holy 
                Places</strong>: The Vatican is a treasure trove of special buildings and shrines. 
                Saint Peter's is the site of Peter's tomb and is built over the original basilica. 
                The Sistine Chapel in the church features the ceiling painted by Michelangelo. The 
                Lateral Palace, once the home of the popes, is now another magnificant building. 
                Saint Peter's Square is known around the world, and the pope often addresses the 
                world from the square. It is also the site of many of his public masses. The religious
                calendar of the Catholic Church is followed, along with the rituals appropriate to that 
                calendar. <strong>Death and the Afterlife</strong>: The beliefs of the Catholic Church 
                in a life after death, the existence of Purgatory, and the efficient of prayers for the 
                dead are followed.

                <p>
                The Vatican has an up-to-date health care system that draws on specialists from around the 
                world.

                <p>
                The Church has a long history supporting the arts. The Vatican is among other things a museum.
                Its library is a major source of knowledge about the Renaissance and European history.

                <br> 
                <p>
                The Vatican is more interested in social sciences than physical sciences. It is not opposed 
                to the physical sciences and has stated its general support for the physical sciences and 
                their compatibility with religion. Within the Vatican, there has been more immediate 
                application of the social sciences, particularly sociology, psychology and political 
                science.

                        prepares delicious meals centered on her own national cuisine, thus covering 
                        another little-known territory of Mediterranean food. Portuguese wines are an extra 
                        feature of this rustic, albeit modernized restaurant.

                    <br>
                    <br>
<h1>1. St. Peter's Basilica</h1>
<br>
<p>
    The centerpiece of the Vatican and one of the best places to visit, the magnificent St. Peter's Basilica 
    was built between the 16th and 18th centuries, replacing earlier structures that began in 326 on what is 
    thought to be where St. Peter was buried. Ironically, it was the selling of indulgences to finance this 
    building in the 16th century that provoked Martin Luther to begin the Protestant Reformation. The work of 
    famous artists begins before you enter the church: in the portico are an equestrian statue of Constantine 
    by Bernini and fragments of a mosaic by Giotto above the main doorway. It's from the old church, as are 
    the double bronze doors. The huge nave - 185 meters long and 46 meters tall - rises to a dome 119 meters 
    above and can accommodate a congregation of more than 60,000. Compare it to the dimensions of other great 
    churches marked in the floor. On your right, Michelangelo's famous Pietà, sculpted when he was only 24, 
    is behind reinforced glass. Also on the right is the richly decorated Chapel of the Sacrament, with 
    Bernini's tabernacle and his rival Borromini's bronze grille. Michelangelo's dome is held on four massive 
    pentagonal piers, and below it, under Bernini's magnificent Baroque bronze baldacchino (canopy), is the 
    Papal altar. Below is the tomb of St. Peter. The bronze throne in the apse, flanked by papal tombs, is 
    also by Bernini. Tombs of more Popes are in the right aisle. Near the Baptistery are the stairs 
    (a lift is outside near the Gregorian Chapel) to the roof, from which you can climb 330 steep steps 
    inside the dome to the lantern for a closer look at the dome's structure and magnificent views over 
    St. Peter's Square. Beneath the church is Vatican Necropolis, the final resting place of several former 
    Popes and said to house the remains of St. Peter himself.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
<h1>2. Piazza San Pietro (St. Peter's Square)</h1>
<br>
<p>
The grand Piazza San Pietro in front of St. Peter's Basilica was laid out by Bernini between 1656 and 1667 
to provide a setting where the faithful from all over the world could gather. It still serves that purpose 
admirably, and is filled to capacity each Easter Sunday and on other important occasions. The large oval 
area, 372 meters long, is enclosed at each end by semicircular colonnades surmounted by a balustrade with 
140 statues of saints. On either side of the oval are fountains, and in the center is a 25.5-meter Egyptian 
obelisk brought from Heliopolis by Caligula in AD 39 and set up in his circus. It was moved here in 1586, no 
small task in those days as the monument weighs 350 tons. The focal point, however, is the façade of the 
basilica, from whose central balcony the Pope delivers his blessings and announces beatifications and 
canonizations. From here also, the senior member of the College of Cardinals proclaims the name of a new 
Pope elected by the conclave.
</p>
    <br>
    <br>
<h1>3. Vatican Gardens</h1>
<br>
<p>
The first parts of the Vatican Gardens were created for Pope Nicholas II in the 13th century, meant to be a 
space for peaceful reflection. Over the centuries, the landscaped gardens, grassy spaces, and orchards have 
grown to cover nearly one-half of the area of the tiny city-state and rival the most beautiful gardens in 
Italy. In addition to the formal French Garden, visitors will find many individually potted plants along 
the paths, which contain stunning azaleas and other lush flowers. Planted among these and in the orchard are 
several rare trees, including an Australian silk-oak, as well as many trees that were brought as gifts by 
official visitors. Perhaps the most significant of these trees is the olive tree, which was presented by the 
State of Israel to symbolize peaceful relations with the head of the Catholic Church. Tours in the garden 
must be arranged in advance through the Vatican Museum.
</p>
    <br>
    <br>
<h1>4. Sistine Chapel</h1>
<br>
<p>
Built by Pope Sixtus IV in 1473-84, the Sistine Chapel is a rectangular hall, which is the Pope's 
domestic chapel, also used for services and special occasions. After the death of a Pope, the conclave 
to elect his successor is held here. The frescoes by Michelangelo and others covering the walls and 
ceiling, acknowledged as the pinnacle of Renaissance painting, were extensively restored from 
1980 to 1994, removing layers of candle-soot, dust, varnish, grease, and overpainting to reveal their 
original luminous colors. The side walls are covered with large frescoes of Biblical scenes against 
the background of Umbrian and Tuscan scenery, painted for Sixtus IV by the most celebrated painters 
of the day - Perugino, Botticelli, Rosselli, Pinturicchio, Signorelli, and Ghirlandaio. These 
late-15th-century paintings already reflect the ideas of humanism, recognizing humans as individuals 
and important in the historical process. The left-hand wall shows Old Testament scenes; the right wall 
New Testament scenes. The frescoes on the ceiling were painted by Michelangelo, almost completely 
unaided by assistants, in the reign of Pope Julius II, between 1508 and 1512. Michelangelo's ambitious 
idea was to depict the Creation as described in Genesis, beginning with God separating light from 
darkness, creating the sun and the moon, separating land and sea, and creating Adam and then Eve, 
and continuing through the story of Noah. Below in the vaulting are colossal figures of the prophets 
and sibyls. Michelangelo began work on the large fresco on the altar wall in 1534, depicting the final scene in the story of the world, the Last Judgment. Its dramatic presentation and artistic finesse rank it as one of the greatest achievements of European painting.

<h1>5. Vatican Palace Highlights: The Raphael Rooms, Appartamento Borgia, and Cappella Niccolina</h1>
<br>
<div class="post-image">

        <img src="./assets/instagram/italy-rome-vatican-museum-raphael-rooms-5.jpg" class="img" alt="italy-rome-vatican-museum-raphael-rooms-5">
    </div>
</div>
<p>
These rooms, commissioned for the Palace of the Vatican's papal apartments by the art-loving 
Pope Julius II and later by Pope Leo X, are covered with a magnificent series of frescoes by Raphael. 
In re-discovering the traditions of historical painting, Raphael began an art tradition that was to be 
followed for centuries. In each of the scenes, he uses a classical symmetry in the composition, 
positioning the characters in perspective around a central focal point. While some scenes were painted 
by students or other great artists after his death, the Stanza della Segnatura and the Stanza di Eliodoro 
were both painted by Raphael himself, as were those in the Sala della Segnatura. Completed between 1508 
and 1511, these works and those in the Sistine Chapel represent the supreme achievement of Renaissance 
painting. The paintings convey that period's culture in all its splendor and show humanist 
themes - the natural sciences attainable without divine revelation, philosophy, history, mathematics, 
civil law, and justice. Pope Alexander VI, a Borgia, had a private residence for himself and his family 
built inside the Vatican Palace, known today as the Appartamento Borgia. Between 1492 and 1495, 
Pinturicchio and his assistants painted a series of scenes that combined Christian subjects with ancient 
and Renaissance humanist themes. The first room shows prophets and Sibyls; the second, the Creed, 
with prophets and Apostles. The third room is decorated with allegories of the seven liberal arts, 
and the fourth with legends of saints. Scenes from the New Testament cover the fifth. It's easy to miss 
this little gem as you leave the Raphael Rooms and go through the Sala dei Chiaroscuro, where your 
attention will be on the wooden ceiling. But in the corner is a small doorway to Nicholas V's Chapel, 
also known as Cappella Niccolina. It is completely lined in frescoes by the Florentine monk of the 
early Renaissance, Fra Beato Angelico. The subjects of the frescoes are the life and martyrdom of 
St. Stephen and St. Lawrence, and like all Fra Angelico's work, these paintings speak of a deceptive 
simplicity, gentleness, and devotion that almost makes you overlook the genius of this talented artist.
</p>
    <br>
    <br>
<h1>6. Pinacoteca (Picture Gallery)</h1>
<br>
<p>
    Even though it was robbed of many of its treasures by Napoleon, the Pinacoteca contains 16 rooms 
    of priceless art from the Middle Ages to contemporary works. Arranged in chronological order, 
    the pictures give an excellent survey of the development of Western painting. Medieval art includes 
    Byzantine, Sienese, Umbrian, and Tuscan paintings, as well as a Giotto triptych and a Madonna and 
    St. Nicholas of Bari by Fra Angelico. There is a triptych by Filippo Lippi, Coronation of the Virgin 
    by Pinturicchio, and a Madonna by Perugino. A room is devoted to tapestries from cartoons by Raphael; 
    his Madonna of Foligno; and his last painting, the famous 1517 Transfiguration. Portraits include da 
    Vinci's unfinished St. Jerome, a Titian Madonna, and Caravaggio's Entombment.
</p>
    <br>
    <br>
<h1>7.Vatican Library </h1>
<br>
<p>
    The value of its contents makes the Vatican Library the richest in the world, with 7,000 incunabula 
    (printed before 1501), 25,000 medieval hand-written books, and 80,000 manuscripts that have been 
    collected since the library's founding in 1450. And that's just the old books; it doesn't count all 
    the books it contains that were printed since the end of the 15th century. In its 70-meter-long hall, 
    built by Domenico Fontana, you can admire some of its most precious treasures: beautiful 
    hand-illuminated Gospels, Biblical codices, early printed books, parchment manuscripts, and ancient 
    scrolls and papyri. The library also has a recently expanded collection of pontifical coins and medals.
</p>
    <br>
    <br>
<h1>8. Egyptian Museum</h1>
<br>
    The Egyptian Museum in the Cortile della Pigna was re-founded in 1839 by Pope Gregory XVI, 
    the first collection having been assembled earlier by Pius VIII. Much of the collection was 
    brought from the Villa Adriana in Tivoli, where they had been collected by the Emperor Hadrian.
    Supplementing Hadrian's collections are artifacts assembled by 19th-century collectors. The 
    compilation here isn't large, but its nine rooms exhibit some fine examples of Egyptian art from 
    the third millennium to the sixth century BC. Highlights include basalt and wooden sarcophagi, 
    sculptures of gods and pharaohs, bronzes, mummified heads, burial reliefs, stelae with hieroglyphic 
    inscriptions, statues of gods and animals, and papyri. In the last two rooms, you'll find art from 
    ancient Mesopotamia, vases and bronzes from Syria, and reliefs from Assyrian palaces.
</p>
    <br>
    <br>
<h1>9.Museo Chiaramonti </h1>
<br>

    The Museo Chiaramonti, founded by Pope Pius VII in the early 19th century, is housed in a long gallery 
    leading to the Papal palace and in the Braccio Nuovo. Concentrating on works of Greek and Roman art, 
    the museum includes a number of Roman copies of earlier works by some of the most famous Greek sculptors, 
    the only record of them that survives. Among the highlights of the thousand-odd sculptures, friezes, 
    and reliefs are the Augustus of Prima Porta, a statue of the emperor found in the villa of his wife Livia; a statue of the god of the Nile; and Spear Carrier, a copy of the work by Polycletus.   
    In the Sala della Biga, near the entrance, are two Discus Throwers, copies of fifth-century-BC works. 
    A funeral monument of a miller dating from the first century was found at Ostia, and two splendid gilded 
    bronze peacocks are thought to have come from Hadrian's Mausoleum.

<h1>10. Collection of Modern Religious Art</h1>
<br>
<p>
    Amid all the antiquities and Renaissance art, a more recent addition to the Vatican treasures was 
    inaugurated in 1973, as a result of an initiative by Pope Paul VI in 1964. The Pontiff noted the 
    gap between the Catholic Church and contemporary art, hoping to bring them closer in the future. 
    That began the extension of the Vatican's small collection of 19th-century art to include more 
    recent works. As with the other Vatican museums, not all the collection - which numbers more than 
    8000 - is on display, but the works shown in galleries between Borgia Apartment and the Sistine Chapel 
    present an overview of 20th-century religious paintings. Works on religious themes in the collection 
    include those by Salvador Dali, Vincent Van Gogh, Marc Chagall, Francis Bacon, Otto Dix, Giorgio de 
    Chirico, and Henri Matisse. An entire room is dedicated to Matisse's Chapel of the Rosary in Vence, 
    France.
