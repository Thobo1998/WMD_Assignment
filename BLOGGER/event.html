                    <h1>The Time Has Come To Visit The Vatican City</h1>
                    <p>
                    At the heart of Rome, The Vatican city is home to the Roman Catholic Church 
                    as is symbolised by St Peter's Basilica. Not only then largest church in the 
                    world, the Basilica also houses the pope at certain points throughout the 
                    year.It is here the following lis of events takes place and are all free to 
                    attend. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <h1>1. Christmas Eve Midnight Mass (24 December)</h1>
                <br>
                
                <p>
                    Another special for the city-state, as St Peter's square is decorated with a 
                    huge Christmas tree which lights up in the plaza, and small nativity decorations 
                    are dotted around the city. As the most watched Christmas mass around teh world. 
                    The Midnight Mass that takes place on Christmas Eve is not actually held midnight, 
                    but at 9:30pm. Beign such a popular time of the year, the Vatican advices people 
                    to apply for tickects 2-6 months in advance. If you find yourself unlucky 
                    competing for such a high demand event, you can still watch it on live screen 
                    outside St Peter's Square with a vast amount of people  to join you, you are still 
                    guaranteed to still enjoy the atmosphere.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>2. New Year’s Parade (1 January )</h1>
                <br>
                
            <p>
                What better way to roll in the New Year than taking part in the New Year’s Parade 
                on the 1st of January. Join the crowded streets and pageantry music as you receive 
                the Pope’s New Year’s Day blessing, followed by a stationary performance in 
                St Peter’s Square to celebrate the first day of the New Year. The route begins at 
                Largo Giovanni XXIII, by the River Tiber, and follows the Vill della Conciliazione 
                road, down to St Peter’s Square. By following the street which links Italy’s 
                capital to the Vatican, the parade demonstrates a sense of solidarity and 
                togetherness, the perfect message to welcome the turn of a New Year. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>3. Papal Audience (Wednesdays year-round)</h1>
            <br>
            
        <p>
            If the Pope is in Rome, a papal audience is held every Wednesday at 11am in St Peter’s 
            Square, allowing the chance for pilgrims and other visitors to see the Pope and receive 
            his blessing. You can collect your tickets the day before the mass at the Papal Household 
            from 3pm onwards, or you can pick them up on the day, any time between 7 – 10am. Although 
            the Papal Audience isn’t scheduled to start until 9:30am, many people arrive early 
            (up to 3 hours before) to get a good seat, you might want to consider doing the same for 
            your visit. This is a great way to experience the Vatican and the influence of the Pope, 
            who conducts the mass in a series of small teachings, speaking as he does so in multiple 
            languages to recognise those who have travelled far to see him. Following a united prayer 
            and the Pope’s blessing, the crowds cheer and wave to the Pope, thanking him for his 
            service. With much flag waving and singing, the service offers a truly uplifting atmosphere, 
            for Christians and non-Christians alike. Check before you go whether the Pope is in Rome or 
            not, as there may be times where he is away on a Pastoral Visit, in which case the Audiences 
            will either not go ahead, or be held at Castel Gandolfo. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>3. Easter (10 April – 13 April)</h1>
        <br>
        
    <p>
        The Vatican City really comes alive in April for the celebration of Easter, or more appropriately 
        for the resurrection of Jesus. The celebrations begin on Good Friday to commemorate the crucifixion 
        of Jesus and lasts until Easter Monday. If you’re looking to visit Rome during this time, be sure 
        to book your accommodation in advance. Like the papal audience service described above, there is a 
        similar Mass service that takes place on Good Friday, where the Pope leads Via Crucis, the Way of 
        the Cross against the backdrop of the Colosseum. Held at around 9pm, this is a very touching and 
        popular procession, where people hold torches and candles up the cross and the Pope, who gives his 
        blessing. This is followed by an Easter Vigil Mass held inside St Peter’s Basilica the next day. 
        Again, tickets are free, but with thousands of people attending trying to get one of the 15,000 
        seats inside the Basilica is still a push. However, you can still enjoy an intimate view of the 
        event in St Peter’s Square where the Mass is screened. Finally, the last must-see event during 
        this week is of course the Easter Sunday Mass held by the Pope in St Peter’s Square. Despite being 
        able to hold a capacity of 80,000 people, the square is still full by the time the service starts 
        at 10:15am. Even with tickets, your place in the square is not guaranteed, so be prepared to get 
        there early to stand and wait. Again, like all the Pope’s services, he blesses the crowd and those 
        who are suffering around the world.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>4. Rome Choral Festival (June)</h1>
    <br>
<p>
    Held for two weeks in June, Rome’s Choral Festival is a series of choir performances from 
    mixed-voice singers from across North America who come together under the instruction of maestro Z. 
    Randall Stroope. Going back to Italy’s musical heritage, these performances are all about musical 
    stimulation, bringing together sight, sound and touch as glorious classical music fills the air. 
    Although the festival tours throughout Italy, it includes a Mass participation at St Peter’s 
    Basilica in the Vatican. With such impressive scenery to complement the glorious and powerful 
    singing from the choir, your trip to Vatican is sure to be unlike any other.
</p>
<br>
<h1>5. The International Festival of Sacred Music and Art (November)</h1>
<br>
<p>
    This Autumn festival brings together outstanding artists from across Italy, 
    including the Vienna Symphony, an orchestra founded in 1842, and considered 
    one of the finest in the world. Known in Italian as the Festival Internazionale di 
    Musica ed Arte Sacra, the festival aims to enrich people spiritually with its music 
    and promote the preservation of an artistic heritage that belongs to all mankind. It 
    lasts for five days in October or November, with performances taking place in Rome’s 
    most important churches, including St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican. The festival hosts 
    a variety of acts from solo artists to choirs, all performing classical music.
